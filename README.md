I applied my Knowledge in Controller Area Network (CAN) in three Cases Studies 
1- Communicate between two STM32F103C8T6 using by CAN using interrupt and Poling mechanism
2-Communicate between STM32F103C8T6 ( Embedded BareMetal ) and Beagle-Bone-Black (Embedded linux) through CAN Socket
3-Accelerator Pedal and Speed Cluster lab A verification testing SW and also a simulation mode against speed controlled by accelerator pedal. I have done it using Vector CANoe with virtual ECUs by appling:
• Database for the used ECUs using Vector CANdb
• CAPL Script for each ECU.
• Designing accelerator pedal and speed cluster panel.
