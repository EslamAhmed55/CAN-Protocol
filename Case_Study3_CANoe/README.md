# Virtual ECU Lab Experience with Vector CANoe! 🚗

Using CAPL scripts, I explored a dynamic interaction between two virtual ECUs while creating a CANdb database to define each ECU logic. 💡

## 🔍 ECU1: The Pulse of Pedal Monitoring
Tasked with monitoring the accelerator pedal's status, ECU1 diligently tracks every press and release.

## ⚙️ ECU2: Speed Control
Armed with real-time data from ECU1, ECU2 takes the driver's intentions and translates them into smooth speed adjustments, 
delivering a responsive driving experience.
